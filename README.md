This is the hello-world github tutorial
By following the tutorial I am learning some of the basics of using github.
At a glance it seems like I don't even need to be using git on my machine, will this prove to be true?
Why am I learning Git?
Git makes sense.
Every week I work on creating a combined file for the rest of my team to work on.
Part of the process is then splitting that file into reasonable chunks for others to work on.
The final results are then merged together.
There are often conflicts and changes made by different people, as well as them keeping multiple versions of their own files.
Using version control, we can keep the same name on different branches and all be referring to the same thing, then merge them together at the end with a lot less work than manually checking the changes.
At least that is the theory...
